> **Life is Short. Do Z-turn!**

"*Sheer egoism*", George Orwell wrote in his famous article *[Why I Write](http://orwell.ru/library/essays/wiw/english/e_wiw)*, "*Desire to seem clever, to be talked about, to be remembered after death, to get your own back on the grown-ups who snubbed you in childhood, etc*". Honestly, this is one of my motivations why I wish to blog here. 

I might be a later bird to start blogging online, but I still wish to try it and keep on. Several years ago, I had a dream to build a personal website, now the dream came true. I should work harder and contribute more to this website, which is a recorder of my life and offers me an opportunity to look back what I have done in the past time. 

I taught myself and finally created this website in the end of 2013 by WordPress, whereas two months later I migrated this website to [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) hosted by [GitHub](http://www.github.com). I do not want to waste too much time on maintaining websites and database. Luckily, GitHub helps me to host all my website's docs and database for free. By far, this is the best choice as I know. With the geat service of GitHub and the plain-text writing interface of Jekyll , I decide to stay here as the home of this website in the near future.
