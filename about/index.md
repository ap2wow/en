## Who I Am? 

I am Xingfeng Si, a fourth-year PhD student at the [College of Life Sciences](http://www.cls.zju.edu.cn/en/) at [Zhejiang University](http://www.zju.edu.cn "Zhejiang University"), China. Difficult to pronunce the Chinese names? Well,  my name *Xingfeng Si* sounds like *Sheeng-ferng Szzz*, and the name of my university *Zhejiang* sounds like *Dr-er Ji-ah-ng*.

## My Research

My research interest generally lies in biogeography, community ecology, conservation biology and ornithology, and could be divided into two topics: island biogeography and wildlife management.

What are the underlying mechanisms shaping the animal distribution on fragmented islands? Do the animal in land-bridge system have similar pattern as expected by the theory of island biogeography? To ask these questions, I started my research of bird communities since 2008 in the [Thousand Island Lake](/en/pages/thousand-island-lake/ "Thousand Island Lake") (TIL), China. TIL is a large inundated reservoir with 1078 islands which was created in 1959 by the construction of Xin'anjiang Dam. This lake is a good land-bridge research system to explore species
distribution and test the traditional theory of island biogeography proposed by MacArthur & Wilson. I used the long-term counts of breeding bird communities to quantify the colonization-extinction dynamics on a set of islands, so as to test the theory. In additions to the bird studies, I used the occupancy data of lizards and small mammals to unveil the biogeographical pattern of beta diversity, which will provide more detail into the biodiversity conservation on fragmented islands. 

Camera trapping of wildlife, especially for some elusive and cryptic animals, had been practiced and become an available method to
estimate the abundance of animals. I collected occupancy data of birds and mammals using camera traps during 2009 - 2012 in [Gutianshan Reserve](/en/pages/gutianshan-reserve/ "Gutianshan Reserve"),
China to estimate the population density adjusted with detectability of each species.

## My Hobby 

I like reading, traveling and
cycling. One of my important dreams is the long travel from [Chengdu to
Lhasa](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China_National_Highway_318) (the capital of Tibet) by bike. I would plan to spend one month to
complete this 2200-km journey. I initiated this dream eight years
ago when I was an undergraduate, while I am always waiting for the right
time to make my dream come true, because it is a great chance to enjoy
the unique landscape and biodiversity of [Qinghai-Tibet Plateau](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qinghai-Tibet_Plateau). I am
also a [postcrossser](http://www.postcrossing.com/user/Xingfeng "Postcrossing"), please [contact me](/en/vitae "CV") if you have an interest to swap postcards with me.

## This Website 

I created this website with [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) and hosted on [GitHub](http://github.com/sixf/sixf.github.io). The theme was modified by [Yihui](http://yihui.name) which was originally derived from [Linghua Zhang](http://lhzhang.com/) and [Tao Zhang](http://ztpala.com/). I do appreciate their great contributions so that I can use this elegant theme directly. When you browse my blog, you could navigate to previous
post by the left-arrow key (`<-`) or next post by right-arrow (`->`). 

If you have any suggestions or find a broken link on this website, please
feel free to email [me](mailto:sixingfeng@gmail.com "Xingfeng's email")
or leave a message [here](/en/guestbook "Guestbook").
