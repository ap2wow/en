## Who I Am?I am a fourth-year PhD student at [Zhejiang University](http://www.zju.edu.cn "Zhejiang University"), China. By far, most of my research focused on animals, especially the birds. When I was a master student, I initialed the researches of monitoring animals using camera traps in [Gutianshan Reserve](/links/gutianshan-reserve/ "Gutianshan National Nature Reserve"), China. Camera trapping is a new available method to estimate animal population, especially for some elusive and cryptic animals. I also participated another parallel project of our group in the [Thousand Island Lake](/links/thousand-island-lake/ "Thousand Island Lake") (TIL), China, which is a large inundated lake with more than one thousand islands. It is a good land-bridge research system to explore species distributions and test the traditional theory of island biogeography proposed by MacArthur &amp; Wilson. Now I am processsing these occupancy data in order to provide more detail into the biodiversity conservation on fragmented islands. ---
## My HobbyI like reading, traveling and cycling. One of my important dreams is the long travel from Chengdu to Lhasa (the capital of Tibet) by bike. I would plan to spend one month to complete this 2200-km journey. I initialed with this dream eight years ago when I was an undergraduate, while I am always waiting for the right time to make my dream come true, because it is a great chance to enjoy the unique landscape and biodiversity of Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. I am also a [postcrossser](http://www.postcrossing.com/user/Xingfeng "Postcrossing"), please feel free to [contact me](/contacts) if you have an interest to swap postcards with me.---
## This WebsiteI created this website with [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) and hosted on [GitHub](http://github.com/sixf/sixf.github.io). The template was derived from [Yihui](http://yihui.name) who modified templates originally from [Linghua Zhang](http://lhzhang.com/) and [Tao Zhang](http://ztpala.com/). I do appreciate their great contributions so that I can use wonderful theme directly.
