## Who I Am?

I am a fourth-year PhD student at <a href="http://www.zju.edu.cn" title="Zhejiang University">Zhejiang University</a>, China. By far, most of my research focused on animals, especially the birds. When I was a master student, I initialed the researches of monitoring animals using camera traps in <a href="/links/gutianshan-reserve/" title="Gutianshan National Nature Reserve">Gutianshan Reserve</a>, China. Camera trapping is a new available method to estimate animal population, especially for some elusive and cryptic animals. I also participated another parallel project of our group in the <a href="/links/thousand-island-lake/" title="Thousand Island Lake">Thousand Island Lake</a> (TIL), China, which is a large inundated lake with more than one thousand islands. It is a good land-bridge research system to explore species distributions and test the traditional theory of island biogeography proposed by MacArthur &amp; Wilson. Now I am processsing these occupancy data in order to provide more detail into the biodiversity conservation on fragmented islands.

##My Hobby

I like reading, traveling and cycling. One of my important dreams is the long travel from Chengdu to Lhasa (the capital of Tibet) by bike. I would plan to spend one month to complete this 2200-km journey. I initialed with this dream eight years ago when I was an undergraduate, while I am always waiting for the right time to make my dream come true, because it is a great chance to enjoy the unique landscape and biodiversity of Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. I am also a <a href="http://www.postcrossing.com/user/Xingfeng" title="Postcrossing">postcrossser</a>, please feel free to <a href="/contacts">contact me</a> if you have an interest to swap postcards with me.
