## Research Interests

- **Breeding bird turnover in Thousand Island Lake, China**

	The Island Biogeography Theory of MacArthur & Wilson provides important insights
into fragmentation because of the proposed similarity of island
surrounded by water and habitat "islands" surrounded by other habitats
inhospitable to the species involved. This theory proposes that the
species' colonization rates to islands depend on their isolation, while
local extinction rates depend on their area. The Thousand Island Lake in
eastern China exactly has the landscape to test this theory. 

	I examined
the factors that determine the colonization and extinction of breeding
birds on island using long-term counts of bird communities.

- **Camera traps in Gutianshan Reserve, China** 
	
	Camera trapping of
wildlife, especially for some elusive and cryptic animals, had been
practiced and become an available method to estimate the abundance of
animals. I investigate the relationship between the population
estimation and trapping rate that can be influenced by a variety of
factors, such as species-specific behavior, species size and patterns of
habitat use. Then I proposed a minimum trapping effort to ensure that we
can detect the wildlife of interest effectively with limited time.
